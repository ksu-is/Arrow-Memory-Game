# Arrow-Memory-Game
General Idea: For this memory game, the player will start by selecting which difficulty they would want to play. For instance, easy mode may have only a few arrows with time to remember before proceeding to the next arrow. While hard mode can have a large amount of arrows shown with a fast switch timer. After the sequence of arrows has been shown, the player must in order recite which arrow appeared. If one is wrong, it will automatically end the game. Though there could be another option where it will let you input every arrow from the sequence and show the total the player got correct and incorrect. I could also implement some sort of time mechanic. This means that after reviewing the arrow sequence, a timer would start counting down. This will add extra pressure towards the player and when the timer hits zero the player will be penalized. For a penalty, I can add some sort of point system. For every arrow guessed correctly, receive a number of points and deduct points when guessing the arrow direction wrong. This can create a sort of leaderboard which will boost competitiveness within the game. The player may feel the urge to do better and will try numerous times to achieve a higher score.
